# Crowdfunding-Analysis-Kickstarter--PowerBi:
📊 Crowdfunding Analysis (Kickstarter) – Power BI And Analysis 

In this project, I conducted an end-to-end analysis of Kickstarter crowdfunding data using Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization. The dashboard was designed to provide interactive insights into campaign performance and funding patterns.

#Key Steps perfomed:

Data Cleaning: Pre-processed and structured large datasets in Excel for smooth integration with Power BI.

Data Modeling: Built relationships and applied DAX measures for dynamic calculations.

Layered Dashboards:

Executive Summary: High-level KPIs (Total Campaigns, Success Rate, Funds Raised).

Exploratory View: Interactive filters to drill down into categories, subcategories, and regions.

Trend Analysis: Time-series insights on campaign launches and success trends.

Detailed View: Breakdown of successful vs failed campaigns with navigation buttons for smooth transitions.

What I learnt:
Experience with this work was trully worth of time. I spent hours on this analysis which was really helpful for me.
I learnt to work under timeline, I have completed this work with excellence within deadline. 
I found myself somehow comorftable in under pressure enviroment which is strange right?

Interactivity: Added slicers, drill-through options, and navigation buttons for user-friendly exploration.

💡The Power BI dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly identify trends, compare performance across categories, and gain actionable insights into the success factors behind crowdfunding campaigns.
