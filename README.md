# Crowdfunding-Analysis-Kickstarter--PowerBi
ðŸ“Š Crowdfunding Analysis (Kickstarter) â€“ Power BI

In this project, I conducted an end-to-end analysis of Kickstarter crowdfunding data using Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization. The dashboard was designed to provide interactive insights into campaign performance and funding patterns.

ðŸ”¹ Key Steps:

Data Cleaning: Pre-processed and structured large datasets in Excel for smooth integration with Power BI.

Data Modeling: Built relationships and applied DAX measures for dynamic calculations.

Layered Dashboards:

Executive Summary: High-level KPIs (Total Campaigns, Success Rate, Funds Raised).

Exploratory View: Interactive filters to drill down into categories, subcategories, and regions.

Trend Analysis: Time-series insights on campaign launches and success trends.

Detailed View: Breakdown of successful vs failed campaigns with navigation buttons for smooth transitions.

Interactivity: Added slicers, drill-through options, and navigation buttons for user-friendly exploration.

ðŸ’¡ The Power BI dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly identify trends, compare performance across categories, and gain actionable insights into the success factors behind crowdfunding campaigns.

Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts on this project! ðŸš€
